## Analysis on Kickstarter Data (Columbia)

## Overview of Project

### A hypothetical client funds her plays from Kickstarter. Her campaign is already successful but she'd like to know, based on the goals and launch date, what can propel her to consistently successful results. 

##Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcome Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals
Although an initial analysis of percentage of goals as shown in this chart leads implies that the most successful goals are less than 5k, but there is also a spike 35K and 45K. ![Outcome vs Goal](![Outcome_vs_Goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14239715/114956163-52cf5080-9e2c-11eb-95a6-e26e1060c9da.png)
These conclusions are deceptive because they show the percentage of each outcome per Goal Dollar Bracket. I was curious how many actual campaigns were in each bracket. I built this chart ![Number of Play Campaigns by Goal] (!![Number of Play Campaigns by Goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14239715/114956496-01739100-9e2d-11eb-8f78-22a26b3da751.png) We realize that the 35K to 45K Goal success has a tiny sample number thus it's statistically insignificant. The vast majority of Goals, both successful and Failing are between the 1K to 5K Goal bracket. I though it would be interesting to break these down to see if we could get more specific about our recommendation. I created this chart of only the Successful Plays with goals between 1K and 5K. ![Successful_Plays_Pie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14239715/114957262-a9d62500-9e2e-11eb-811d-e9ef38ae95b0.png)







### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results: 2 Conclusions based on Launch Date
Based on Goals, the client will have the most success with goals between $1000 and $3500.
